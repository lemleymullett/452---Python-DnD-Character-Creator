# 452---Python-DnD-Character-Creator
Final project for Foundations of Information Technology 
This is a work in progress. Hopefully will contain:
1) program that takes in a user's input and outputs a "complete" character sheet. given that character sheets can get wildly complicated or be very simple, this "complete" part will vary (and also depends on how much I get done, tbh)

2) program that organizes spells and can organize them based on what a user wants to see

3) Me figuring out GitHub! LOL
