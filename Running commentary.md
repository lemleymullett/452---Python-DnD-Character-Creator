# Character Sheet
Holy guacamole did I bite off more than I can chew! Well, at least in my given time frame, that is. Here's how it went down:

My first attempt to dummy code the program revolved around trying to break up the pieces of the potential program and put them into functions. This seemed simple enough-- I knew Races and Classes would need to be attended to separately, and tried to think ahead to more fiddly bits like armor class and weapons, but then assumed it wouldn't be THAT fiddly and put it aside to focus on the ability scores, which I KNEW would be difficult to think through.

When I next went in to attack the code, I realized that my thinking process is mostly top-down, so I kind of ignored my previously made functions and just started writing the code introduction, thinking about what I'd need to 

In class we mostly used dictionaries to tally the number of times a word appeared in a chunk of text. In this code I realized that it could be used to hold all kinds of information on one subject, so I used it to hold information on 
What I haven't yet explored is a dictionary within a dictionary, which might be needed when I hit the spellcasting stuff properly.

I feel like I got a good chunk of the 

My output ended up a bit simpler formatting-wise than I orginally imagined, bu tI think that's for the better- this way, a user can easily fill out the parts on their printout character sheet. I'm extremely pleased with my ability score table, though. I'm really proud that I managed to look up how to organize nested lists, And use those same lists to make 

Missing:
Skill proficiency
Armor class that isn't just the default
Subraces -> other than human, half orc and half elf, 

Overall I'm happy with what I have done and I'm excited to keep going in my own time. I really want to make this good!!!
